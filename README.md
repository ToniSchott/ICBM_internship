# ICBM_internship
The files you will need to reproduce the plots implemented in my internship report.
1) You can either just run the r_files "data_plots_internship.r" and " data_anova_internship.r" to directly plot,
2) or go the long way and structure the data yourself again from the raw data (i.e. "data_structure_internship.r" )
have fun!
